# MuMiN-Trawl
This repository contains the source code used to construct, from scratch, the
MuMiN dataset from the paper [Nielsen and McConville: _MuMiN: A Large-Scale
Multilingual Multimodal Fact-Checked Misinformation Dataset with Linked Social
Network Posts_ (2021)](https://openreview.net/forum?id=sOLdMFkQe7).

The idea behind releasing this repository is to give developers and researchers
a way to extend the MuMiN framework, or to use parts of this project to further
research in related projects.
